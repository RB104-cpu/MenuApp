## Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo SDK 48)
- React Navigation for routing
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Express + http-proxy-middleware for port forwarding

## Development
- **Run locally**: `npm run web` or `bash start-web.sh`
- **Port Configuration**: App runs on port 5000 (proxies to Expo webpack on 19006)
- **Data Storage**: Uses AsyncStorage for client-side persistence

## Replit-Specific Configuration
- Webpack configured to allow all hosts for iframe proxy support
- Proxy server forwards requests from 5000 â†’ 19006
- CI mode enabled for Metro bundler
